# HOMEPAGE Project
This repository documents my process in creating my personal website -- from initial UI design to the code.
## Objectives
The primary goal of the website itself (and this GitHub repository) is to get myself hired by potential employers.  My primary target audience is an employer looking for a junior developer to join their team.

The secondary goal of the website is to display my projects and document my work process for collaboration and feedback.

## Requirements
This project uses Adobe XD for the UI wireframes and prototyping.  The pages are coded with HTML and CSS.
### Design Files
The necessary programs, fonts, and plugins to view the .xd files used for the design are as follows:
* [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
* [IBM Plex Sans font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans)
* [IBM Plex Sans Condensed font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans+Condensed)
